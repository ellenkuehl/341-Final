  <center><h2>Secrets/Cheats and Same-Sex Marriage myth</h2></center>
  <p>There are many similar cheats between MFOMT and BTN!</p>

  <ul><li><a href="http://www.neoseeker.com/harvestmoon-gba-girl/cheats/gba/">Neoseeker</a> has a large amount of secrets/cheats available! Neoseeker also is a great forum for HM questions!</li>
  </ul>



<p>It was also speculated that same-sex marriage is available in this game. Unfortunatley, this is not true! But, fans have created a 'True Love Edition.' The
  True Love Edition is available with instructions <a href="http://kataiki.tumblr.com/FOMT-TL">here!</a> This edition allows all fans, regardless of sexuality, to participate in the game! I have also seen a physical copy of the True Love Edition on Ebay, but wethere or not this is legitimate, is hard to say.</p>
  <center><h2>Where can I buy this game?</h2></center>
  <p>This game is more recent than Back To Nature, and is widely available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-More-Friends-Mineral-Town/dp/B0008JILTA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494645060&sr=8-1&keywords=harvest+moon+more+friends+of+mineral+town">Amazon!</a> I have also seen incredibly cheap, used versions on Ebay! </p>
