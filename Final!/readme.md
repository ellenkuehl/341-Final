### My final Project!! So Excited! :)

## The Secrets of Harvest Moon


I have been playing Harvest Moon since I was 6 years old. I grew up in the very tiny town of Bridger, Montana which had two cafes, a grocery store, one post office, two gas stations, and a video store. So what does a child do when growing up in a town this size? Go to the video store ALL the time.

When I discovered Harvest Moon, I begged my mom to let me do chores so I could rent this video game over and over and over, again. One day, when I went to the video game store to rent the game, the owner offered the game to me for $5.

*It has been a love story ever since.*

When thinking of a concept for my final project, I thought, what about doing a page for the 'secrets' that I've discovered throughout this game? And also general less known concepts and gameplay in Harvest Moon. This may seem like a nerdy idea, but this could actually be a published site as Harvest Moon is one of the most famous games in Japan that has crossed the seas to The United States.
So my idea is to create a simple home page with a web title, navigation bar, and potentially a link to a youtube video to entertain the main page. The navigation bar will have links to About(about the website and my life with Harvest Moon), Gallery(images of HM), Back To Nature(link to the secrets of BTN), Save The Homeland(links to the secrest of STH), and (if time) A Wonderful Life (secrets of A Wonderful Life). I may add a dropdown menu to add links to Amazon where people can buy the games or something along that line..


Here is my roughdraft! ![alt text](http://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q369/EllenMKayy/IMG_1035_zpsxuk69wzo.jpg)

I've noticed that I'm the kind of person where my creativity unfolds as I progress through a project. So I'm hoping to add EVEN MORE!! We'll see what I can whip out during finals :) I look at some website pages and admire the creativity and the difficult coding they take. My hope is to focuse most of my time on this class so I can produce a beautiful website. I feel like I've learned quite a bit, but I'm nervous my website won't be up to par. So I must study hard!
