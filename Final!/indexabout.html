  <h1>🌼🍓 The History of Harvest Moon 🍄🌼 </h1>
  <h2>From the beginning...</h2>
<p>Harvest Moon was developed by Japanese artist Yasuhiro Wada who grew up on a farm outside of Tokyo. When Wada moved to Tokyo to further his career, he missed the country and noticed many values and elements of the countryside that deserved appreciation. This inspired his idea for Harvest Moon. More on Wada <a href="http://harvestmoon.wikia.com/wiki/Yasuhiro_Wada">here!</a></p>
<p>Now, Harvest Moon is considered a Japanese legend, and one of the most popular games in Japanese history! Most Harvest Moon games have the same introduction and storyline-the main character's grandfather dies, so they acquire the farm and are challenged to bring the land back to life!

<p> This site is about celebrating Harvest Moon, discussing the differences between male and female game versions, as well as sharing tips and secrets of the HM series. I have decided to begin with some of my favorite games, and will continue to add as I go! For more information on Harvest Moon, I have embeded two videos both talking about Harvest Moon's creational history. The video on the left is about 25
  minutes, the one on the right is about 7 minutes. Everyone has time to learn about Harvest Moon! Please enjoy!</p>

  <h2 align="left">What are the main <span style="color:pink">components</span> of Harvest Moon games?</p></h2>
  <p>In most Harvest Moon games, there are several factors that influence the outcome of the game!</p>
<p>🍅They are <span style="color:green">farming</span> simulators, so obviously, farming is one of the main money producers in the games! Many town villagers love certain crops, so farming can boost your relationships, bring income, and even unlock events! In certain games, like Another Wonderful Life, you can even mutate your seeds to create
  unique plants/crops. If you choose not to farm in your game, you will miss out on unlocking certain events. You will also never know if Mary likes sweet potatoes or zuchinni. <p>
    <p>🍙 The <span style="color:green">food/cooking</span> allows your player to regain strength and increase stamina! Many villagers love a homemade meal, and several festivals in the game require a homemade food exchange.</p>
      <p>🍄 The <span style="color:green">foraging</span> is important in HM, as this is another way to increase income and unlock events! Getting used to the map in your HM game will make your journey much easier!</p>
      <p>💎 <span style="color:green">Mining</span> for metals and gems, as well as chopping wood, is essential in HM games, as this is how a player levels-up their house, upgrades tools, and creates jewelry or other items.</p>
      <p>💕 <span style="color:green">Relationships</span> allow the player to unlock secret events, recieve rare items, and even recruit others for help! Also, getting married is a huge part of this game, as are general relationships!</p>
      <p>🎊 <span style="color:green">Festivals</span> let the player increase relationships, attend a fun event, and discover rare items!</p>
      <p>🐔 <span style="color:green">Animals</span> produce eggs, milk, cheese, wool- things that the player can use to make gifts, or cook with!</p>
