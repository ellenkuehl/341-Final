<center><h2>üåæHarvest Moon and Meüåª</h2></center>
<center><h3>(üçâA love story‚ù§Ô∏è) </h3></center>
<p>Harvest Moon has been in my life since I was 6 years old! I grew up in tiny-town Montana on a large farm. When I wasn't outside digging in the dirt and playing with animals, I depended on the local video store to provide entertainment! My meeting with Harvest Moon was accidental; my best friend was the one who originally
  showed Harvest Moon Back To Nature while browsing the video game section. I thought the game looked boring, and didn't want to play. Eventually, my best friend convinced me. After this, I
  was <b>obsessed!</b> I started using my allowance to rent Harvest moon. And then after I used my allowance, I started begging my mom for chores, so I could keep playing.
  Since our town was so small, the owner of the video store offered to sell me the game for $5! I gratefully bought the game, and the rest is history!</p>

  <p>Now, I am a proud owner of all the Harvest Moon video games, except for the DS versions. My favorites being Back To Nature, Tree of Tranquility, and Save The Homeland. Absolutely love them all, though! (The graphic design in <i>A Wonderful Life</i> was <b>AMAZING!</b>)</p>
<p> I started this page in hopes to connect with other HM lovers, and to inform other girls about the fun female-version games! There's a reason HM is so popular...everyone can enjoy!</p>
