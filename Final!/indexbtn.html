<center><h4><i>Back to Nature</i> and <i>Back to Nature for Girl</i> are almost identical in game design and play. A few noteable differences are:</h4></center><ul>
  <li>The game introduction. You can see the difference in the videos above!</li>
  <li>The female version was never released in America, leaving Americans to translate the game, and uploading translation videos.</li>
  <li>The marriage candidates.</li>
  <li>When you are married in the female game, the game ends. The original BTN game is literally endless (players have reported playing 50+ years).</li>
  <li>You cannot have children in the female version.</li>
  <li>House decor is more feminine in the female version.</li>
  <li>Villager's 'daily speech' is different between the two games.</li>
  <li>Your role in certain festivals (Goddess Festival, Thanksgiving Festival, etc.) is different in each.</li>
</ul></p>

<center><h2>Secrets/Cheats</h2></center>
<p>Harvest Moon Back To Nature is one of the most mysterious in the game series. There are many surprises throughout the game that one would never know! Most
  of these cheats and secrets aren't even listed in the guide! An example of this: if you throw a cucumber in the mountain lake after 11pm on a spring day, a Kappa will appear! If you throw three cucumbers in, the Kappa wil give you a <i>Mystic Berry!</i>
<p>Since Back To Nature's female version has never been translated, there is little knowledge about the secrets/cheats within the game. Many forums state that
  the female version shares the same cheats as the original version. Below are links that will you help you with your journey!</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://fogu.com/hm/btn4g/">Ushi No Tane</a> has one of the best explanations of the BTN girl version! Their guides are great in general, would reccomend bookmarking!</li><li>
  <a href="http://www.harvestmoonbacktonatureguide.com/secrets.html">This site</a> is based around the original BTN, but the secrets should work for both games.</li>
<li>Most secrets aren't widely published, so <a href="http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/1167/t9038-secrets/">here</a> is a forum where you can dig to find more!</li>
</ul>

<center><h2>Where can I buy this game?</h2></center>
<p>Unfortunately, this Back to Nature game is one of the hardest to find. It took my sister and I days of wandering through Book Off's in Japan to find our copies. Sometimes a copy will appear on Amazon, as well as Ebay! Otherwise, it would be best to
  search independent sellers. </p>
